# Changelog

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) starting from v2.0.0.
Earlier releases used sequential numbering (#1-#5) matching the upstream
[eyra/feldspar](https://github.com/eyra/feldspar) convention.

## [Unreleased]

## v2.0.1 — 2026-05-04

### Fixed

* 2+ GiB upload `NotReadableError` regression. `FlowBuilder` no longer
  materializes `PayloadFile` uploads to a path; the
  `AsyncFileAdapter` is passed directly to `zipfile.ZipFile`,
  validators, and extractors (extraction/AD0007). Restores the
  streaming behavior of upstream eyra/feldspar PR
  [#482](https://github.com/eyra/feldspar/pull/482), which the
  FlowBuilder rewrite (`68c59d8`) silently reverted by adding a
  full-file `adapter.read()` inside `materialize_file()`. The
  resulting single-`ArrayBuffer` request triggered
  `FileReaderSync.readAsArrayBuffer`'s ~2 GiB cap with
  `NotReadableError`, often after a long apparent hang. Empirical
  reproduction and full diagnosis:
  [#61](https://github.com/d3i-infra/data-donation-task/issues/61).

### Changed

* Upload-path size validation now uses `adapter.size` (JS metadata,
  no read) before any byte transfer, instead of `os.path.getsize`
  on a materialized `/tmp` copy. The new helper is
  `uploads.check_payload_size(file_result)`. The previous
  `materialize_file()` and `check_file_safety(path)` are removed.
* `ZipArchiveReader.__init__` and `validate.validate_zip` now accept
  any seekable binary file-like (`IO[bytes]`) or a path string; the
  upload pipeline passes an `AsyncFileAdapter` directly. Parameter
  names (`zip_path`, `path_to_zip`) are retained for backwards
  compatibility with researcher-fork callers and will be renamed in a
  follow-up release.
* `FlowBuilder.start_flow()` accepts only `PayloadFile` uploads.
  `PayloadString`/WORKERFS support (kept for SURF Research Cloud
  backwards compatibility per `feldspar/AD0003`) is retired; SRC
  consumers must migrate to `PayloadFile`.
* New host log milestones: `[<Platform>] Upload prompt sent`
  (emitted before the file prompt render command goes to the host),
  `[<Platform>] Upload received: size=…` (emitted immediately after
  a `PayloadFile` upload, before the safety check), and
  `[<Platform>] Upload skipped: type=<X>` (emitted when a
  non-`PayloadFile` payload arrives, distinguishing participant-skip
  from unexpected payload types). Replaces the previous
  post-materialize `[<Platform>] File received` message.

### Removed

* `materialize_file()` and `check_file_safety()` from
  `port.helpers.uploads` — see Changed above for replacements.
* The dual-payload-type branch (`PayloadFile` or `PayloadString`)
  in `FlowBuilder` upload handling. Closes the deprecation window
  opened by `feldspar/AD0003`.

### Architectural Decisions

* `extraction/AD0007` — Stream `PayloadFile` uploads end-to-end and
  never materialize to a path. Succeeds `extraction/AD0003` (whose
  ownership decision is preserved; only the size-check placement
  changes).

## v2.0.0 — 2026-03-23

Incorporates upstream eyra/feldspar #6 (2026-02-25) and #7 (2026-03-05), plus
d3i extraction consolidation, platform updates, and bridge alignment.

### Breaking

* File delivery uses PayloadFile (FileReaderSync) instead of WORKERFS/PayloadString
* CommandSystemLog forwarding from Python and JS to host platform
* Donation keys changed from `{session_id}` to `{session_id}-{platform_name}`
* script.py rewritten as FlowBuilder orchestrator — forks using the old script.py pattern must migrate
* ScriptWrapper catches all Python exceptions as PII safety boundary (AD0009)

### Added

* FlowBuilder: standard template for per-platform extraction flows (extraction/AD0001)
* ZipArchiveReader: deterministic archive member resolution with cached inventory (extraction/AD0006)
* ExtractionResult dataclass with Counter[str] error counting
* Chrome platform extraction
* Upload validation — file type and size checks before extraction (extraction/AD0003)
* PII-safe logging boundaries — explicit CommandSystemLog yields for host-visible milestones, local loggers for diagnostics (AD0011)
* Per-platform release builds via VITE_PLATFORM env var (fork-governance/AD0005)
* Verification commands: `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck:py`, `pnpm verify:py`, `pnpm doctor`
* 74 Python unit tests
* Dependency update CI workflow
* DISCLAIMER.md (EUPL)
* 20+ architectural decision records in `docs/decisions/`

### Changed

* All 9 existing platforms migrated to FlowBuilder + ZipArchiveReader + bilingual headers
* Font: Finador replaced with Nunito (open-source)
* Tailwind CSS v3 → v4
* Dataframe truncation limits (Python + TypeScript) to prevent UI overload
* Status text shown during data submission
* Error page shows user-friendly message instead of stacktrace
* Async donation responses via PayloadResponse (backward-compatible with PayloadVoid)
* Case-insensitive search in consent table (from eyra #6)
* Lithuanian and Romanian translations (from eyra #6)

### Removed

* `d3i_example_script.py` — superseded by FlowBuilder pattern
* `donation_flows/` extraction system — consolidated into FlowBuilder (AD0006)
* `script_custom_ui.py` — eyra demo script, not used by d3i platforms
* `d3i_py_worker.js` — dead code, all worker traffic through `py_worker.js`
* Dead CI workflows: `_build_release.yml` (Earthly), `playwright.yml`, `release.yml`
